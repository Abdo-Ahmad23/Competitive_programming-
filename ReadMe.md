# The repository covers a variety of topics, including:

    - Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, Graphs, etc.
    - Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer, Backtracking, and more.
    - Mathematics: Number Theory, Combinatorics, and Modular Arithmetic.
    - String Manipulation: Pattern Matching, Palindromes, and more.
    - Graph Theory: DFS, BFS, Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall), and Topological Sorting.
    - Optimization Techniques: Space and time optimization for efficient solutions.
# The solutions are organized by language:

    - C++: For efficient, performance-focused solutions leveraging the Standard Template Library (STL).
    - Python: Known for its simplicity and versatility, with solutions using built-in data structures and libraries.
    - PHP: Offers practical solutions for competitive programming challenges in a less common but still powerful language.
